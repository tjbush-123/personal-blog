# Personal Blog

## Description

My motivation was to make an established personal blog. I built this project for anyone who wants to see my personal blogs. This problem solves anything that someone wants to know what I am talking about for certain topics. I learned how to use javascript with my projects and how it helps with projects in general.

## Usage

This is a personal blog to see blogs that I post.
